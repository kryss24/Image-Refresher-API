You get your own bedroom and bathroom! The unit is completely furnished including bed, mattress, desk, desk chair, couch, flat screen tv in the living room. The apartment also comes with appliances such as washer & dryer, microwave, stove, two door fridge with filtered water. The base rent is around $1100 which covers fees and most utilities. It doesn\u2019t cover electric which is only on average $20 a month. Move in would be early August. The apartment is right next to the parking garage and just down the hall from the trash room so you wouldn\u2019t have to walk too far. It also has a balcony facing Kennesaw mountain which is BEAUTIFUL at sunset. Bixby has plenty of study rooms/game rooms also an amazing gym and pool! There is access to vending machines on each floor. 5 minute drive to campus and is in range of the BOB shuttle busses that take you to and from campuses. Please reach out if you are interested!

You get your own bedroom and bathroom! The unit is completely furnished including bed, mattress, desk, desk chair, couch, flat screen tv in the living room. The apartment also comes with appliances such as washer & dryer, microwave, stove, two door fridge with filtered water. The base rent is around $1100 which covers fees and most utilities. It doesn\u2019t cover electric which is only on average $20 a month. Move in would be early August. The apartment is right next to the parking garage and just down the hall from the trash room so you wouldn\u2019t have to walk too far. Elevators also work all year long and helps SO much with moving in. It also has a balcony facing Kennesaw mountain which is BEAUTIFUL at sunset. Bixby has plenty of study rooms/game rooms also an amazing gym and pool! There is access to vending machines on each floor. 5 minute drive to campus and is in range of the BOB shuttle busses that take you to and from campuses. Please reach out if you are interested! It would be such a huge help if someone could take this over for her!",
