I'm offering a lease takeover at Harper on Piedmont, located at 625 Piedmont Ave NE. The remaining lease would run from 09/01/2025 until 06/02/2026 with opportunity for a renewal (rent has not increased for 2 years).\n\nYou can move in as early as August 26, though the official lease would start September 1. The base rent is $1200 per month, with all utilities and internet included it would come down to around $1300.\n\nThe apartment includes a large private balcony with city and pool views, as well as a gym and a (optional) private underground parking spot. The location is perfect for students or young professionals working/studying in Midtown. It\u2019s walking/cycling distance to Georgia Tech, close to Ponce City Market, the BeltLine, and the Metro station at North Ave. Midtown convenience doesn't get much better than this.\n\nYou\u2019ll be sharing the living room, kitchen and balcony with Amaury, a respectful and easygoing roommate originally from France who keeps shared spaces tidy and is frequently out of town visiting his girlfriend in LA. That means you\u2019ll have the place to yourself pretty often! The room itself is just a bedroom with a big walk-in closet and private bathroom.\n\nSince I\u2019m relocating abroad, I\u2019d be happy to leave behind some furniture for a small fee including a bed, desk, and a few other essentials to make your move-in smooth.\n\nFeel free to message me if you\u2019d like to schedule a visit, have any questions, or would like to meet your potential future roommate!",

Location is really excellent - bike ride distance from the Beltline with storage space for bikes, tools, etc. Less than 5 min drive from EAV, Edgewood, Candler Park, Grant Park, L5P, two Krogers, Target, Marshall's, Lowes, and Best Buy. 5 min walk from the excellent El Tesoro Mexican restaurant with a walking/biking path right in front of the house. Right next to I-20. Less than 10 mins from downtown and O4W and Chick-Fil-A.\n\nRooms are rented on individual leases.  Home is unfurnished, so bring your stuff!   Utilities (electricity, gas, water) and internet are not included, but the landlord can manage those if you like.  One lease per bedroom (couples can take two rooms).  Security deposit equal to one month\u2019s lease.  \n\nThe bedrooms are large and separated, so there's tons of privacy. Granite countertops and Shaker cupboards make the kitchen extremely functional. Each bathroom has a full bath and tiled shower. The closets are large, and there's extra storage in the attic and basement. The upstairs is a bedroom bungalow with a large bonus room, 2-sink full bath with tiled shower, and walk-in closet. The living area gleams with natural light and polished hardwood floors.\n\n***Updates including an updated paint scheme and new flooring in all the bedrooms. By the time you move in, there will be no carpeting left in the house -- only wood or faux-wood floors.***\n\nHere's what the prior tenant wrote about me, the homeowner, in a prior advertisement for a housemate: \"Landlord is excellent - responsive, understanding, and we've had zero issues the entire 2 years i've been here.\" I do my best to create a great experience and sustained quiet enjoyment for the residents. We fix things quickly and are in direct touch -- there's no property-management company in between.\n\nTwo cars can park in the driveway in tandem. Street parking isn't ever really crowded.\nPets are ok. There will be an additional $300 deposit and $50 pet rent for animals.  \n\nShowings will be held Saturday July 5, 12, 19, and 26, 10-1pm, unless rented prior. Serious applicants can schedule a showing on-demand. Call Shan at 770 572 0094 with questions about showings, and call or email Jennie at 424 750 2095, jennieday@gmail.com with questions directed at the homeowner.\n\nWe screen all applicants. We respect and follow the United States Fair Housing Act and the Georgia Fair Housing Law, and welcome all applicants that meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Minimum credit score 650\n2. No lines of negative credit or collections\n3. No evictions\n4. No criminal record\n5. Income of at least 2.5x rent or share of rent\n6. Proof of income\n7. Government-issued ID and in-person or video verification of identity match\n8. Proof of immediately-prior six months of rent payments to landlord or comparable documentation\n9. One rental reference that says they would rent to this applicant again, who are willing to speak on the phone or Zoom, or in person\n10. Each adult must meet criteria; income may be combined.",

I'm a pretty social guy, and I like to be good friends with my roommates. I'm usually down to explore the city or go out on weekends.

GA TECH STINGER BUS STOP STEPS AWAY AND NEAR TWO MARTA STATIONS.\n\nThe space includes a FULLY FURNISHED PRIVATE BEDDROOM, PRIVATE BATHROOM, AND PRIVATE VERY LARGE WALK-IN CLOSET located in a 3 Bedroom / 3 Bathroom 1,216 square foot apartment. THE DEN, KITCHEN, AND VERY LARGE BALCONY ARE SHARED SPACES WITH TWO OTHER FEMALE ROOMMATES. A relet means that we notify the apartment you want my daughter's specific room. You then apply directly with the apartment complex, and once approved, you will rent the room directly from the apartment, replacing my daughter\u2019s lease. The lease runs August 2025 and will run through July 2026. \n\nThe apartment is not only walking distance to Tech Square, the 5th Street Bridge/greenspace, and a Georgia Tech student transportation Stinger bus stop, but also to Barnes & Noble Bookstore at Tech, Publix, Moes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray\u2019s New York Pizza, Insomnia Cookie, Starbucks, Subway, Waffle House, LA Fitness, and so much more. It is also close to The Fox Theatre, The Varsity, two MARTA stations, and just a short drive to Piedmont Park, Ponce City Market, Mercedes Benz Stadium, Centennial Olympic Park, the airport, and easy access on and off the highway. While the apartment is right by Georgia Tech, my daughter has been in grad school at Georgia State University, and it has been such a short, easy commute for her at just 2.2 miles to the Urban Life Center on GSU campus. \n\nAs a grad student, my daughter has lived here for four years and loved it. As a parent, I have loved knowing she was in a safe and very walkable area. She has loved being on the 3rd floor where she could opt for the elevator or take the stairs one flight up from the lobby. She has also loved her closet, as it is by far the largest of all the three bedrooms in the unit.\n\nRent would be $1,395. She has been paying $90 per month for parking, adjacent to the 2nd floor lobby of the apartment complex, but there are other package options. Renters insurance through Square On 5th is $14 monthly or you can get your own. Utilities are based on usage, itemized, divided among the three tenants, and billed with your rent. The other two rooms have been allocated to females, so the space we are renting would also have to go to a female tenant. \n\nSquare On 5th is located at 848 Spring Street in Atlanta. It has a rooftop pool, game room, fitness center, and study spaces, lots of activities, and incredible views of the city and all of Tech campus and so much more. \n\nI\u2019m sure you all would love it just as much as she has.

GA TECH STINGER BUS STOP STEPS AWAY AND NEAR TWO MARTA STATIONS.\n\nThe space includes a FULLY FURNISHED PRIVATE BEDDROOM, PRIVATE BATHROOM, AND PRIVATE VERY LARGE WALK-IN CLOSET located in a 3 Bedroom / 3 Bathroom 1,216 square foot apartment. THE DEN, KITCHEN, AND VERY LARGE BALCONY ARE SHARED SPACES WITH TWO OTHER FEMALE ROOMMATES. A relet means that we notify the apartment you want my daughter's specific room. You then apply directly with the apartment complex, and once approved, you will rent the room directly from the apartment, replacing my daughter\u2019s lease. The lease runs August 1, 2025 and will run through July 31, 2026. \n\nThe apartment is not only walking distance to Tech Square, the 5th Street Bridge/greenspace, and a Georgia Tech student transportation Stinger bus stop, but also to Barnes & Noble Bookstore at Tech, Publix, Moes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray\u2019s New York Pizza, Insomnia Cookie, Starbucks, Subway, Waffle House, LA Fitness, and so much more. It is also close to The Fox Theatre, The Varsity, two MARTA stations, and just a short drive to Piedmont Park, Ponce City Market, Mercedes Benz Stadium, Centennial Olympic Park, the airport, and easy access on and off the highway. While the apartment is right by Georgia Tech, my daughter has been in grad school at Georgia State University, and it has been such a short, easy commute for her at just 2.2 miles to the Urban Life Center on GSU campus. \n\nAs a grad student, my daughter has lived here for four years and loved it. As a parent, I have loved knowing she was in a safe and very walkable area. She has loved being on the 3rd floor where she could opt for the elevator or take the stairs one flight up from the lobby. She has also loved her closet, as it is by far the largest of all the three bedrooms in the unit.\n\nRent would be $1,395. She has been paying $90 per month for parking, adjacent to the 2nd floor lobby of the apartment complex, but there are other package options. Renters insurance through Square On 5th is $14 monthly or you can get your own. Utilities are based on usage, itemized, divided among the three tenants, and billed with your rent. The other two rooms have been allocated to females, so the space we are renting would also have to go to a female tenant. \n\nSquare On 5th is located at 848 Spring Street in Atlanta. It has a rooftop pool, game room, fitness center, and study spaces, lots of activities, and incredible views of the city and all of Tech campus and so much more. \n\nI\u2019m sure you all would love it just as much as she has.

GA TECH STINGER BUS STOP STEPS AWAY AND NEAR TWO MARTA STATIONS.\n\nThe space includes a FULLY FURNISHED PRIVATE BEDDROOM, PRIVATE BATHROOM, AND PRIVATE VERY LARGE WALK-IN CLOSET located in a 3 Bedroom / 3 Bathroom 1,216 square foot apartment. THE DEN, KITCHEN, AND VERY LARGE BALCONY ARE SHARED SPACES WITH TWO OTHER FEMALE ROOMMATES. A relet means that we notify the apartment you want my daughter's specific room. You then apply directly with the apartment complex, and once approved, you will rent the room directly from the apartment, replacing my daughter\u2019s lease. The lease runs August 1, 2025 and will run through July 31, 2026. \n\nThe apartment is not only walking distance to Tech Square, the 5th Street Bridge/greenspace, and a Georgia Tech student transportation Stinger bus stop, but also to Barnes & Noble Bookstore at Tech, Publix, Moes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray\u2019s New York Pizza, Insomnia Cookie, Starbucks, Subway, Waffle House, LA Fitness, and so much more. It is also close to The Fox Theatre, The Varsity, two MARTA stations, and just a short drive to Piedmont Park, Ponce City Market, Mercedes Benz Stadium, Centennial Olympic Park, the airport, and easy access on and off the highway. While the apartment is right by Georgia Tech, my daughter has been in grad school at Georgia State University, and it has been such a short, easy commute for her at just 2.2 miles to the Urban Life Center on GSU campus. \n\nAs a grad student, my daughter has lived here for four years and loved it. As a parent, I have loved knowing she was in a safe and very walkable area. She has loved being on the 3rd floor where she could opt for the elevator or take the stairs one flight up from the lobby. She has also loved her closet, as it is by far the largest of all the three bedrooms in the unit.\n\nRent would be $1,395. She has been paying $90 per month for parking, adjacent to the 2nd floor lobby of the apartment complex, but there are other package options. Renters insurance through Square On 5th is $14 monthly or you can get your own. Utilities are based on usage, itemized, divided among the three tenants, and billed with your rent. The other two rooms have been allocated to females, so the space we are renting would also have to go to a female tenant. \n\nSquare On 5th is located at 848 Spring Street in Atlanta. It has a rooftop pool, game room, fitness center, and study spaces, lots of activities, and incredible views of the city and all of Tech campus and so much more. \n\nI\u2019m sure you all would love it just as much as she has.

I enjoy the quiet, but I\u2019m totally fine with more social or lively roommates, too.\nSome things I\u2019m into: music, reading and writing, collecting media (I\u2019ll likely be bringing my record collection), to-do lists, and wandering around aimlessly.\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\nMidtown or anywhere walkable to GT campus or a MARTA station\n\nBudget: Up to $1300 for studio/1B, under $1000 with roommates\n\nIn-unit washer/dryer, parking\n\nPet-friendly (ideally, but not required)\n\nQueer or queer-friendly home\n\nFeel free to DM me if you\u2019re looking for a roommate or have a spot available!",

The den, kitchen, and large balcony are shared spaces with two other female roommates. A relet means that we notify the apartment you want my daughter's specific room. You then apply directly with the apartment complex, and if approved, you will rent the room directly from the apartment, replacing my daughter\u2019s lease. The lease can begin as early as August 1, 2025 and will run through July 31, 2026. \n\nSquare on 5th is student living steps from Tech Square and the 5th Street Bridge and green space next to Tech campus. In fact, a bus stop for The Stinger, Georgia Tech\u2019s student bus system, is also just steps away. The apartment is also walking distance to Barnes & Noble Bookstore at Tech, Publix, Moes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray\u2019s New York Pizza, Insomnia Cookie, Starbucks, Subway, Waffle House, LA Fitness, and so much more. It is also close to The Fox Theatre, The Varsity, two MARTA stations, and just a short drive to Piedmonth Park, Ponce City Market, Mercedes Benz Stadium, Centennial Olympic Park, the airport, and easy access on and off the highway. \n\nWhile the apartment is right by Georgia Tech, my daughter has been in grad school at Georgia State University, and it has been such a short, easy commute for her. As a parent, I have loved knowing she was in a safe and very walkable area. She has loved being on the 3rd floor where she could opt for the elevator or take the stairs one flight up from the lobby. She has also loved her closet, as it is by far the largest of all the three bedrooms in the unit. \n\nRent would be $1,395. She has been paying $90 per month for parking, but there are other package options. Renters insurance through Square On 5th is $15 monthly or you can get your own. Utilities are based on usage, itemized, divided among the three tenants, and billed with your rent. The other two rooms have been allocated to females, so the space we are renting would also have to go to a female tenant.\n\nSquare On 5th is located at 848 Spring Street in Atlanta. It has a rooftop pool, game room, fitness center, and study spaces, lots of activities, and incredible views of the city and all of Tech campus and so much more. You can visit their website at www.squareonfifth.com to see all they have to offer.\n\nI\u2019m sure you all would love it just as much as she has. Please private message me if you are interested and I can send you more information.",

Very easy access to 75 and 85, and a 15-minute walk to Peachtree St, which is along Bus #110's route to Arts Center MARTA. Alternatively, it's ~15 minutes drive to Lindbergh Station.\n\nI have set my move-in date for August 8, but there may be a bit of flexibility if you need to move in after that. Base rent is $865/person for a 12-month lease, combined with utilities I am expecting ~$950/each total. For a more detailed breakdown, just ask! I've attached the floorplan. My previous place was furnished, so any furniture for the common area is appreciated! The leasing office shared a video tour of a near-identical unit, but it is more than a minute long so I can't post it - please reach out if you'd like to see it!\n\nA bit about me - I just turned 26, originally from Central Florida and moved to Atlanta in 2022. I work for the Environmental Protection Division, part of the State of Georgia's Dept. of Natural Resources. My job is mostly WFH but I do go into the office once a week, and occasionally have overnight travel around the state. When I'm not working, I am usually going to the gym or scoping out new cafes to read at/work from. I'm also pretty active in the community - I volunteer with a research lab at Emory, and volunteer at the Peachtree Road Farmers Market! Other hobbies include movies, reading, and going to concerts. Feel free to ask!\n\nIdeally, I am looking for a roommate around my age and is also working - recent grads are cool, too! No preference on gender, since we'd have our own bathrooms. I've lived with both male and female roommates in the past and had good experiences! I mostly keep to myself but have been close with a couple roommates, too.",
