I'm offering a lease takeover at Harper on Piedmont, located at 625 Piedmont Ave NE. The remaining lease would run from 09/01/2025 until 06/02/2026 with opportunity for a renewal (rent has not increased for 2 years).\n\nYou can move in as early as August 26, though the official lease would start September 1. The base rent is $1200 per month, with all utilities and internet included it would come down to around $1300.\n\nThe apartment includes a large private balcony with city and pool views, as well as a gym and a (optional) private underground parking spot. The location is perfect for students or young professionals working/studying in Midtown. It\u2019s walking/cycling distance to Georgia Tech, close to Ponce City Market, the BeltLine, and the Metro station at North Ave. Midtown convenience doesn't get much better than this.\n\nYou\u2019ll be sharing the living room, kitchen and balcony with Amaury, a respectful and easygoing roommate originally from France who keeps shared spaces tidy and is frequently out of town visiting his girlfriend in LA. That means you\u2019ll have the place to yourself pretty often! The room itself is just a bedroom with a big walk-in closet and private bathroom.\n\nSince I\u2019m relocating abroad, I\u2019d be happy to leave behind some furniture for a small fee including a bed, desk, and a few other essentials to make your move-in smooth.\n\nFeel free to message me if you\u2019d like to schedule a visit, have any questions, or would like to meet your potential future roommate!",

GA TECH STINGER BUS STOP STEPS AWAY AND NEAR TWO MARTA STATIONS.\n\nThe space includes a FULLY FURNISHED PRIVATE BEDDROOM, PRIVATE BATHROOM, AND PRIVATE VERY LARGE WALK-IN CLOSET located in a 3 Bedroom / 3 Bathroom 1,216 square foot apartment. THE DEN, KITCHEN, AND VERY LARGE BALCONY ARE SHARED SPACES WITH TWO OTHER FEMALE ROOMMATES. A relet means that we notify the apartment you want my daughter's specific room. You then apply directly with the apartment complex, and once approved, you will rent the room directly from the apartment, replacing my daughter\u2019s lease. The lease runs August 2025 and will run through July 2026. \n\nThe apartment is not only walking distance to Tech Square, the 5th Street Bridge/greenspace, and a Georgia Tech student transportation Stinger bus stop, but also to Barnes & Noble Bookstore at Tech, Publix, Moes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray\u2019s New York Pizza, Insomnia Cookie, Starbucks, Subway, Waffle House, LA Fitness, and so much more. It is also close to The Fox Theatre, The Varsity, two MARTA stations, and just a short drive to Piedmont Park, Ponce City Market, Mercedes Benz Stadium, Centennial Olympic Park, the airport, and easy access on and off the highway. While the apartment is right by Georgia Tech, my daughter has been in grad school at Georgia State University, and it has been such a short, easy commute for her at just 2.2 miles to the Urban Life Center on GSU campus. \n\nAs a grad student, my daughter has lived here for four years and loved it. As a parent, I have loved knowing she was in a safe and very walkable area. She has loved being on the 3rd floor where she could opt for the elevator or take the stairs one flight up from the lobby. She has also loved her closet, as it is by far the largest of all the three bedrooms in the unit.\n\nRent would be $1,395. She has been paying $90 per month for parking, adjacent to the 2nd floor lobby of the apartment complex, but there are other package options. Renters insurance through Square On 5th is $14 monthly or you can get your own. Utilities are based on usage, itemized, divided among the three tenants, and billed with your rent. The other two rooms have been allocated to females, so the space we are renting would also have to go to a female tenant. \n\nSquare On 5th is located at 848 Spring Street in Atlanta. It has a rooftop pool, game room, fitness center, and study spaces, lots of activities, and incredible views of the city and all of Tech campus and so much more. \n\nI\u2019m sure you all would love it just as much as she has.

I do have a large dog named Laika and he is friendly, but preferably we would not like another large dog in the house. No cats unfortunately because of allergies. You must be responsible for your personal cleanliness and organization, we are pretty strict about chores here LOL. Besides that we\u2019re pretty relaxed! We often have friends over and throw parties so you\u2019re more than welcome to join in the festivities! \n\nRent is $2100 total, so it would be $700 split three ways.

IT IS IN MIDTOWN, NEXT TO TECH SQUARE AND THE 5TH STREET BRIDGE BY GEORGIA TECH.  IT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE 2025 - 2026 SCHOOL YEAR. \n\nWith this FULLY FURNISHED relet, you would let us know you are interested in our specific space in this C3 Floorplan 3 Bedroom / 3 Bathroom unit. We would then notify the apartment, you would apply directly through Square on 5th/Bhom, and if approved, we would no longer be part of the lease at all. You would be leasing direct from the apartment complex. Having lived here in this apartment for four years, I feel the 3rd floor and my bedroom, bathroom, and closet specifically, are THE BEST. As you see, my space has by far THE LARGEST CLOSET in the apartment. The lease runs August 1, 2025 through July 31, 2026. Rent would be $1,395. I have been paying $90 per month for parking, but there are other package options. Renters insurance through SQ5 is $15 monthly or you can get your own. Utilities are based on usage, itemized, having been divided among the three total female tenants, and posted and paid with your monthly rent bill.\n\nSquare on 5th is student living steps from Tech Square and the 5th Street Bridge by Tech Campus. I attend Georgia State University and it is perfect for someone attending Georgia Tech or GSU. In fact, a bus stop for The Stinger, Georgia Tech\u2019s student bus system, is steps away. The apartment is also walking distance to Barnes & Noble Bookstore at Tech, Publix, Moes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ray\u2019s New York Pizza, Insomnia Cookie, Starbucks, Subway, Waffle House, LA Fitness, and so much more. It is also close to The Fox Theatre, The Varsity, two MARTA stations, and just a short drive to Piedmont Park, Ponce City Market, Mercedes Benz Stadium, Centennial Olympic Park, the airport, and easy access on and off the highway.\n\nSQ5 has a rooftop pool, game room, gym, study spaces, lots of activities, incredible views of the city, and all of Tech campus, and so much more.\n\nIf interested, please message me. Thank you so much.",

(East side of Georgia Tech campus)\n\nPrice: $1,229/mo plus utilities (see below for more info)\n\nLease Term:  August 2025-July 2026 (1 year or 12 months)\n\nTo be clear - you will be taking over my current lease which is a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom space in a 4 bedroom/4 bathroom apartment for 12 months.  I am not allowed to alter the length of the lease or the monthly rent as these were the terms that I agreed to in my original lease. Once you are approved by Catalyst, you will become the new tenant to the 1 BR/1BA legally and I will no longer be in the picture. (You will be taking over all the financial and legal terms of my lease. I won't be involved afterwards. All payments will be made to Catalyst and any non-payment will be your financial responsibility. I won't be your \" landlord\") This is not meant to be harsh, just letting you know that once you take over my lease, your lease agreement will be with Catalyst, not me.\n\nI have no control over who the other roommates will be, so if you have friends you want to live with, they will have to apply separately with Catalyst and name you as preferred roommate. If you wait too long, you may not be able to pick your roommate(s) as they start \"assigning\" roommates in July.\n\nInterested?  Contact me through FB Marketplace or directly meganmcnerney@comcast.net\n\nApartment features include:\n* D1 floor plan - 1,272 sq.ft.\n* Private bedroom and bathroom (NO sharing!)\n* Fully Furnished \n* Shared Common Living Space & Kitchen\n* Hardwood Floors throughout\n* Washer/Dryer (share)\n* Catalyst has an all-inclusive utility package for $70/month. That means electricity, water, sewer, trash, and high-speed internet.\n\nCommunity features include:\n* Pool\n* Gym\n* Clubhouse with private study rooms, fast Internet access, free printing, maker space work lab\n* Skydeck\n* Dog park\n* Package lockers\n* Bike repair/storage\n* 25/7 maintenance\n* After hours security\n\nMy lease agreement does not include extra fees for parking garage, utilities or pets, etc.  See below additional info from Catalyst's website.\n\nOptional Extra Fees:\n* Parking space is available in Catalyst's gated garage for an extra fee.  This fee is NOT included in monthly price above.\n* Catalyst has an all-inclusive utility package (electricity, water, sewer, trash, and high-speed internet) for $70/month in addition to the monthly price listed above! \n* Catalyst is Pet Friendly!  Don't know what the extra fee or terms are to bring your dog/cat, especially since you will have roommates.",

I work remote full time for a tech company so I take pride in creating a beautiful cozy living environment. I\u2019m half Greek and have spent most of my 20s so far living in Europe between Sweden and Greece. I love to host dinner parties (cooking is my love language), play board games, read, and go out dancing to disco and house music. \n\nABOUT THE LOCATION:\n- 7 minutes from West End Breweries!\n- 10 minutes to Grant Park\n- 15 minutes to EAV + Edgewood \n- 10 minutes to the airport \n- 16 minutes to piedmont park\n- Close to south side belt line and Pekerson park\n(All of these are without traffic)\n\nIf you think this sounds like somewhere you\u2019d like to live, let us know!
